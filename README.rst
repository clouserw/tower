Tower provides some additional functionality to Jinja and it's i18n extension,
and the Babel library.

* Author: Wil Clouser and contributors_
* Licence: BSD
* Compatibility: Python 2.6 and 2.7, Django 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6
* Requirements: django, babel, jinja2, jingo and translate-toolkit
* Project URL: https://github.com/clouserw/tower
* Documentation: http://tower.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

.. _contributors: https://github.com/clouserw/tower/contributors

Specifics:

- Pulls strings from a variety of sources: Python, JavaScript, and .lhtml files.
- Collapses whitespace in all strings to prevent unwieldy msgids.
- Supports Gettext context (msgctxt) in all gettext, and ngettext calls.
- Supports merging PHP and Python .pot files.  This is temporary.  If you want
  to support that for an extended time look at phppo2pypo in the `Translate Toolkit
  <http://translate.sourceforge.net/>`_.


Requirements
============

* Django
* Babel
* Jinja2 and Jingo
* translate-toolkit

See `requirements.txt <https://github.com/clouserw/tower/blob/master/requirements.txt>`_
for details.


Installation
============

Install from pypi with::

    pip install tower

Source code is at `<http://github.com/clouserw/tower>`_.

Install from GitHub with::

    pip install -e git://github.com/clouserw/tower.git#egg=tower


Configure
=========

Add to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your Django settings file::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # ...
        'tower',
        # ...
    )

Then configure.

``django.conf.settings.DOMAIN_METHODS``

    **Default:** None--you must set this.

    The value is a dict of domain to file spec and extraction method tuples.

    For example, this creates a domain "messages" and in that domain
    extracts all the l10n strings from .py and .html files::

        DOMAIN_METHODS = {
            'messages': [
                ('fjord/**.py', 'tower.extract_tower_python'),
                ('fjord/**.html', 'tower.extract_tower_template'),
            ]
        }

    Use ``tower.extract_tower_python`` for Python files and
    ``tower.extract_tower_template`` for Jinja2 templates.

    The l10n strings will be saved in a .pot file with the name of the
    domain. In the above example, it'd be ``messages.pot``.

``django.conf.settings.STANDALONE_DOMAINS``

    **Default:** ``['messages']``

    By default, all domains specified in ``DOMAIN_METHODS`` get merged
    into one big .pot file. If you don't want that, you can specify
    which domains get their own .pot file with ``STANDALONE_DOMAINS``.

``django.conf.settings.TOWER_KEYWORDS``

    Gettext keywords are the actual names of the functions your application uses
    to denote strings which should be extracted.  Babel defines a sane default
    list in `DEFAULT_KEYWORDS
    <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/babel/blob/af983/babel/messages/extract.py#L31>`_
    which includes the regulars like _(), gettext(), ngettext(), etc.  If your
    app uses different functions you'll need to define them here.  This setting
    is a dictionary and the value follows `gettext's keywordspec
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#index-adding-keywords_002c-xgettext>`_.

    If you set this, it is *merged* with Babel's DEFAULT_KEYWORDS setting.

    Example::

        # We lazy load strings in our classes so we can cache them and they are
        # still localized in the right language for the end user.  This will let
        # us use _lazy('Localized string').
        TOWER_KEYWORDS = {
            '_lazy': None,
        }


``django.conf.settings.TOWER_ADD_HEADERS``

    **Default:** False

    If you have trouble extracting strings with Tower, try setting this
    to True.

``django.conf.settings.ROOT``

    This points to the source code directory where you want your
    ``locale/`` directory to be.

``django.conf.settings.path``

    This is a function that takes arbitrary set of args and combines
    them with ``ROOT`` to form a new path.

    Example::

        import os

        # The settings file is in fjord/fjord/settings/base.py. From
        # base, up two directories is the initial fjord directory
        # which is where all the source code and the fjord Django
        # project are.
        ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__))

        path = lambda *args: os.path.abspath(os.path.join(ROOT, *args))

``django.conf.settings.TOWER_INSTALL_JINJA_TRANSLATIONS``

    **Default:** True

    By default tower will ensure it's gettext and ngettext functions are
    installed into Jinja2 on every call to ``tower.activate()``.  You likely
    want this, but if you need to provide your own gettext and ngettext
    functions, set this to ``False``, and in your project call
    ``jingo.env.install_gettext_translations`` or
    ``jingo.env.install_gettext_callables``.


Usage
=====

Extract::

    ./manage.py extract


Merge::

    ./manage.py merge


A note on whitespace
====================

When tower extracts strings, it collapses whitespace. This makes it easier
for localizers. It also means you need to use ugettext, ungettext, ugettext_lazy
and ungettext_lazy from tower. Otherwise the msgids being passed in won't have
their whitespace stripped and thus won't match anything in your .mo file.


A note on ``safe``-ness
=======================

L10n strings are marked "safe" for Jinja2 automatically, so they will not be
HTML-escaped::

    {{ _('Hello <strong>World</strong>') }}

This works as expected. When interpolating into an L10n string, however, it will
be marked as "unsafe" and escaped, unless you use `jingo's
<https://github.com/jbalogh/jingo/>`_ ``|fe()`` helper (which will escape the
arguments but not the string they are interpolated into). Like this::

    {{ _('Hello <strong>{0}</strong>')|fe(user.nickname) }}


Run tests
=========

Run::

    python run_tests.py

To test on all supported versions of Python and Django::

    $ pip install tox
    $ tox
